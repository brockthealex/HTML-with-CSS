/* Explanation:
h3 = selector
{color:green;} = declaration
color = property
green = value */

/* The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value.
A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon ( ; ), 
and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly brackets ( {} ).*/

/* CSS Selectors:
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their element name, id, class, attribute, and more. */

/* The element Selector:
The element selector selects elements based on the element name.
You can select all <h3> elements on a page like this (in this case, all <h3p> elements will be green): */

h3 {
    color: green;
}

/* The id Selector:
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
The id of an element should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
The style rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="test-ID": */

#test-ID {
    color: blue;
  }

/* The class Selector: 
The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.
In the example below, all HTML elements with class="center" will be center-aligned: */

.center {
    text-align: center;
  }

/* HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.
In the example below, the <p> element will be styled according to class="center" and to class="large": */

.center {
    text-align: center;
  }
  .large {
    font-size: 30px;
  }
